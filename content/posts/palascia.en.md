The Punta Palascìa lighthouse represents one of the symbols of Otranto. It is located 40 km from Lecce and is the most eastern point of Italy. It is located at *40°06'26" N, 18°31'14" E*. When parked near the military base literally on the main street it starts the main path to the lighthouse; it's a 10 minutes downhill path that lets you enjoy the view, the wind and the lighthouse from above.
