October '19 - Spain
{{< /typeit >}}

I visited the catalan capital with two of my closest friends a few months ago. Gaudì has literally affected every inch of this city with his influence. Among various activities, we visited Casa Battlò, Parc Güell, Sagrada Familia and the Castell de Montjuïc reached by cableway.

While reaching the Castell of Montjuïc by cableway you were able to see a beautiful panorama of all the buildings in Barcelona, including the Sagrada Familia; to reach Parc Güell we took the metro and we stopped at the Vallcarca station. The Vallcarca district is the secondary entrance to the parc, in fact it's 200m lower than the parc itself.

We walked all the way up to the parc, following this hill with escalators and plants between streets and buildings. It was very weird while going uphill.

Once we entered the parc we found this amazing view of all Barcelona. Personally I think it's a normal shot but I wanted to include it as to finish the storytelling through photos that I just did. From here you can notice the tower cranes that trap the Sagrada Familia.

The parc was completely covered in bathroom tiles. Jokes aside it was very interesting and the following pic is from the main entrance to the parc, which of course we missed while doing the escalator-thing.

Unfortunately a vast part of the parc was under renovations so the pictures weren't that great. This is the gallery that encloses the main structure of the parc near the entrance.

The majesty of the cathedral really blew us away. Coming from the *Passeig de Sant Joan*, the Sagrada Familia appears out among the trees almost as if they were used to indicate the way to reach it, as if it weren't obvious already where the cathedral is. At the time, October 2019, it was still under construction and it will be until 2026; in this regard, I tried to remove the enormous amount of yellow cranes around the construction site. But still there's something left.

The outside is fully covered of sculptures, but the real magic that everyone talks about takes place inside. The following photo represents the main arch of the cathedral and the play of light from the windows creates a surreal atmosphere. It is impossible to describe it so you will have to enter it to understand what I am talking about.

I tried to recreate what I saw inside a few months ago via editing saturation and luminance of each color channel. Gaudì's idea was to recreate a forest inside, in fact there are no paintings on the walls and the main columns in the center of the nave are reminiscent of trunks in shape and color.  
The two glass windows of the two side aisles are opposed by color palette, in fact the one on the left with cold colors like blue and green contrasts with the right aisle with warm colors like red and yellow.

I hope this digital guide has been clear enough for you. Lately I've tried to find new alternative methods to publish the photos I take, but the truth is that they were all temporary solutions for my special needs. At the bottom there's a general summary that I published in a single post on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7igrvAoDsW/). Looking at the post you immediately understand the obvious reason why I opened this website.
