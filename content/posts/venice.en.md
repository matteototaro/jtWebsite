<h3> Venice, Italy, 2017 </h3>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
<strong>In 2017 I went to Venice, Italy for my second time and I shot lots of photos.</strong> It is a magical city, especially if you visit it with someone special to you. In fact I wasn't alone 'cause it's a city only visited by couples but, for reason left to the understanding of the reader, the following pics represent the beauty of just the city itself. <br>
The entry image is a personal revisitation of the city obtained via Photoshop messing around with shadows and saturation of different colors. The main goal was obviously to recreate a painting and, in my opinion, I think I reached it.<br><br>

I wanted to publish the ones I think I considered the best back in the day more than 3 years ago, in fact the edit in the next image is what I consider being by far the furthest way of editing photos compared to today's standard.

This is a classic venetian shot from a bridge that connects two different streets. I really like the yellow light that comes from an artisan shop.

The last one is a recent revisitation that I did just because I came across this photo after 3 years and I didn't like the way I edited back in the day. So I took a step back and I edited it again with today's eyes.
