April '17 - Veneto, Italy
{{< /typeit >}}

**Almost three years ago I went to Venice, Italy for my second time and as always I shot lots of photos.** It is a magical city, especially if you visit it with someone special to you. In fact I wasn't alone 'cause it's a city only visited by couples but, for reason left to the understanding of the reader, the following pics represent the beauty of just the city itself.

The entry image is a personal revisitation of the city obtained via Photoshop messing around with shadows and saturation of different colors. The main goal was obviously to recreate a painting and, in my opinion, I think I reached it. This city is surely very famous and in particular this specific angle that I'm showing you in the next picture is one of the most characteristic.

I wanted to publish the ones I considered the best back in the day more than 3 years ago, in fact the edit in the next image is what I consider being by far the furthest way of editing photos compared to today's standard.

    {{< gallery-image

        title="Venice Lucetta"
        caption="A classic venetian shot from a bridge with yellow light from an artisan shop" >}}

The previous and the following shots are terrible if compared to my today's standards: the sky is violet so they're not realistic but, as I mention in one of my article on this website, the main goal was to showcase this evolutionary process in order to look back at my errors and learn from them.

    title="Venice Barca"

The last one is a recent revisitation that I did just because I came across this photo after 3 years and I didn't like the way I edited back in the day. So I took a step back and I edited it again with today's eyes.
