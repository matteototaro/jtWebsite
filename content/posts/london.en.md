I've been in the United Kingdom almost 4 years ago and during my journey in Cardiff I visited the city of London.

The following three photos are three panoramic views respectively from Camden Town, the Tower of London and the bathroom of the Queen.

On one hand, the first two panos are 4 different shots merged together; on the other hand the last pic is quite a mess and the **full** quality project can be found [*here*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sIa2JbRFzuH99andlX49eVrF9cCUz8/view?usp=sharing).

I also decided to include this project that I did 3 years ago with various images of London. I don't consider it good, just interesting I think.
