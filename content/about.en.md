<p style="text-align:justify;">
My name is Matteo Totaro, I'm 23 and I'm from Reggio Emilia, Italy.</strong><br><br>
<strong>I love photography</strong>, in fact this website was built to create a personal angle in the vast WorldWideWeb to place part of my albums in order to give them more glory and credit. Also I wanted to save them from the conversion-alghoritms of social media.<br>
Recently I got my bachelor degree in Electronic Engineering obtained in Modena at the Department of Engineering "Enzo Ferrari".
Shortly after, I built this website almost from scratch in order to learn more about other programming languages like HTML and CSS in an alternative way.<br><br>
<strong>This static site</strong> has been built in about 3 weeks with the open source framework
<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> during april 2020, when the entire world was quarantined at home due to the virus.<br>So I took this time to focus on personal projects exactly like this one you're reading.<br>
The site is hosted on Netlify, which takes all the files from a public repository on Github.<br>
Thanks for stopping by and have a great day!</p>
