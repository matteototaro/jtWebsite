  <p><strong>I love photography</strong>, in fact this website was built to create a personal angle in the vast WorldWideWeb to place part of my albums in order to give them more glory and credit. Also I wanted to save them from the conversion-alghoritms of social media.<br>
  Recently I got a bachelor degree in Electronic Engineering acquired in Modena.
  Shortly after, I built this website almost from scratch in order to learn more about other programming languages like HTML and CSS in an alternative way.<br><br><br>
  <strong>This static site</strong> has been built in about 3 weeks with the open source framework
  <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> during april 2020, when the entire world was quarantined at home.<br>So I took this time to focus on personal projects exactly like this one you're reading.<br>
  The site is hosted on Netlify, which takes all the files from a public repository on Github.<br>
  The main goal of this space is to publish my previous and future projects so the pictures will be put up just like they are, with the purpose to create a sort of <i>personal museum</i> to observe the evolutionary process over time. I have a Nikon D5300 with a super boring 18-55mm, eventually I'll buy more lenses.<br>
  Thanks for stopping by and have a great day!</p><br><br>
