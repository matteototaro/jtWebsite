**My name is Matteo Totaro, I'm 23 and I'm from Reggio Emilia, Italy.**

I love photography, in fact this website was built to create a personal angle in the vast WorldWideWeb to place part of my albums in order to give them more glory and credit. Also I wanted to save them from the conversion-alghoritms of social media.

Recently I got my bachelor degree in Electronic Engineering obtained in Modena at the Department of Engineering "Enzo Ferrari".
Shortly after I built this website almost from scratch in order to learn more about other programming languages like HTML and CSS in an alternative way.
