My name is **Matteo Totaro**, I am 23 and I'm from Reggio Emilia, Italy.

I love photography, in fact this website was built to create a personal angle in the vast *WorldWideWeb* to place part of my albums in order to give them more glory and credit. Also I wanted to save them from the conversion-alghoritms of social media.

I have a bachelor degree in Electronic Engineering obtained at the Department of Engineering "Enzo Ferrari" in Modena.

My other interests are astronomy, space, music,  electronics and programming. After my degree I built this website almost from scratch in order to learn more about other programming languages.
